"""A wrapped config must reach the family that models it.

Some checkpoints ship a multimodal wrapper: the top level carries
``architectures``, the vision tower and the token ids, and every shape the
decode graph needs sits under ``text_config``. ``hybrid_graph`` learned to
descend into it; the sparse-MoE and GLM predicates and the dense reader did not.

The consequence is not a worse graph, it is a graph of a different model.
``detect_family`` returns ``"dense"``, ``_model_spec_from_hf`` raises on the
wrapper's missing ``hidden_size`` and is swallowed by its own ``except``, and
``predict_graph(model=None)`` returns the Llama-2-7B default. Observed on an
8x MI355X run against Kimi K2.5: ``"family": "dense"``, 161 nodes, every
residual measured against a model that was not running.
