"""Reading a cluster experiment back into the record the loop ranks from.

The harness runs experiments across a fleet and hands the server to
``gitm capture serve``, which leaves ``serving_summary.json`` and
``run_manifest.json`` per arm. ``load_history`` reads
``runs/<id>/verification.json``, and only ``run_loop`` writes one — so every
result measured on the cluster was invisible to the ranking that reads history.
A loop that proposes experiments and cannot see their results is the failure the
history reader exists to prevent, one layer out.
