"""The GLM-5.2 (``glm_moe_dsa``) decode graph, pinned against the checkpoint.

Every assertion guards a term that separates GLM-5.2 from the DeepSeek-V4 sparse
family it was forked from, or a wiring seam a plausible-but-wrong graph would slip
through:

* IndexShare — only ``full`` layers emit indexer nodes; ``shared`` layers reuse
  the selection and carry no indexer weights,
* MLA KV traffic scales with the shared latent, never ``n_heads``,
* the dense prefix runs an FFN, not a mixture,
* precision is read per op, not per model — bf16 by default, and on the FP8
  checkpoint fp8 everywhere the quantiser went and bf16 where it did not,
* the predicted footprint matches *both* published checkpoints, 1.507 TB bf16 and
  753.33 GB fp8,
* prefill and decode disagree about what ``index_topk`` buys — it bounds the core
  in both phases but bounds the *bytes* in only one,
* the MTP chain is D stages deep with D vocabulary projections, not one of each,
* ``detect_family`` routes ``glm_moe_dsa`` before the structural sparse-MoE test.

# ── GLM-5.3-Flash: KDA + MLA, priced as all-MLA ──────────────────────────────
#
# zai-org/GLM-5.3-Flash interleaves 34 KDA linear-attention layers with 11 MLA
# layers. No family holds both, so the entry takes glm_moe_dsa and prices every
# layer as MLA. These pin what the entry does get right — the 11-layer indexer
# schedule read from the weight map (the config says 45), the dense prefix, the
# fp8 split — and pin the known footprint gap so nobody reads it as a fit.
