"""Choosing the restart mode, and refusing one that cannot work.

A structural knob can only be measured by rebuilding the engine. Parallel mode
builds the candidate while the baseline is still up; serial releases the
baseline first and rebuilds it afterwards. The default was parallel, and on the
MI355X run it cost **27 of 29 candidates** — each one building into a device the
baseline already held 90% of, and dying of OOM.

The constraint was written down in `workloads.py` ("in parallel mode
baseline+candidate must both fit") and enforced nowhere.
