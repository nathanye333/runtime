"""The sparse-MoE decode graph, pinned against hand-derived numbers.

Every assertion here guards a term the dense graph does not have. The dense
model is not merely *imprecise* on this architecture — it is wrong in specific,
nameable directions, and each test below pins the correction:

* expert weight traffic saturates (union, not multiplication),
* the attention core's read stops growing with context,
* the KV latent is shared across query heads,
* fp4/fp8 tensors price against fp4/fp8 peaks, or say they didn't.

A regression on any of these produces a confidently wrong ceiling, which the
headroom report would then bill against.

# ── MiMo-V2.5: the windowed-attention hybrid ─────────────────────────────────
#
# A third member of the hybrid family, and the one that breaks the family's
# founding assumption that "not full attention" means "recurrent". MiMo's 39
# sliding-window layers re-read a KV cache exactly as full attention does — they
# just read at most 128 entries of it. Priced as linear their cache read
# vanishes; priced as unbounded it is overstated 64x at 8k context. Each test
# below pins one number that would otherwise be confidently wrong.
#
# Aliased imports, as above: this module hosts three families whose readers share
# function names.

# The shape of XiaomiMiMo/MiMo-V2.5, trimmed to the keys the planner reads —
# the same convention as ``V4_CONFIG`` above, and for the same reason: a test
# that reads a checkpoint off a developer's disk skips everywhere else, so the
# tests that matter most (the family it classifies as, and the inverted
# ``hybrid_layer_pattern`` polarity) would never run in CI.
#
# ``test_the_two_readers_agree`` is what keeps this honest: it compares every
# non-exempt field of the spec built from here against the catalogue YAML, so a
# key dropped in trimming fails loudly rather than quietly weakening the check.
# Verified spec-identical to the full 57-key config.json at the time of writing.
