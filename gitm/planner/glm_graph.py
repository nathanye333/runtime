"""Predicted execution graph for a GLM-5.2-class (``glm_moe_dsa``) engine step.

A fork of :mod:`gitm.planner.moe_graph`, specialised for Z.ai's
``GlmMoeDsaForCausalLM``. Both families are sparse-MoE with a lightning indexer,
but the attention differs in kind, not degree, so a shared spec would carry a
field for each that is dead on the other. The two graphs live apart and share
only the canonical op names (so residuals stay comparable) and
:func:`~gitm.planner.roofline.distinct_experts` (one owner, no drift).

Shape and provenance are in ``docs/glm-5.2/DESIGN-NOTE.md`` and in the catalogue
entries' ``provenance`` blocks; this docstring carries only what constrains an
edit to *this file*.

Four properties do the work, and each has a plausible wrong reading:

**MLA + DSA on every layer, no compression schedule.** One KV latent
(``kv_lora_rank``) shared across all query heads. Deriving cache traffic from
``num_key_value_heads * head_dim`` is the classic MLA error and overstates it 50x
on GLM-5.2 — the config's ``num_key_value_heads: 64`` is a red herring.

**IndexShare.** ``indexer_types`` is ``full`` | ``shared`` per layer; a ``shared``
layer reuses the previous ``full`` layer's top-k and physically carries no indexer
tensors. Emitting an indexer on all 78 layers overstates it ~3.7x.

**Dense-then-sparse MLP.** ``first_k_dense_replace`` leading layers have no router
and no experts. Modelling them as MoE invents traffic the weight map denies.

**Three precisions in one block**, read from
``quantization_config.modules_to_not_convert`` and ``moe_router_dtype`` rather
than assumed. On GLM-5.2-FP8 the backbone GEMMs *including* ``o_proj`` are fp8
while the *indexer*, ``lm_head`` and the MTP ``eh_proj`` are not — the inversion
of the usual fp8-backbone layout. :attr:`GlmMoeDsaModelSpec.op_dtype_overrides`
carries it; one ``weight_dtype`` cannot.

Known limits, stated rather than hidden:

* **Prefill is not decode with a bigger M.** ``index_topk`` bounds the core's
  FLOPs in both phases and its *bytes* in neither: at prefill every query selects
  a different top-k and their union is the whole cache. See :func:`core_qk_pairs`
  and :func:`core_read_entries` — reusing ``BatchConfig.attention_qk_pairs`` here
  is wrong in both directions at once, and the errors partly cancel.
* **Uniform routing.** ``distinct_experts`` assumes a balanced router; real skew
  touches fewer experts, moving *less* traffic — the conservative direction.
* **``ep_imbalance`` is calibrated, not predicted.** It stays 1.0 until a trace
  measures it.
* **Collectives are bandwidth-plus-one-launch**, flagged ``estimated``, and still
  reported unpriced when the SKU carries no interconnect bandwidth.
* **MTP cost is predicted; acceptance is not.** The graph prices D drafts and a
  1+D verify and leaves the payoff to :attr:`BatchConfig.tokens_per_step`.
* **Node names are constrained by the pairing contract.** Every op emitted here
  must be classifiable by :func:`gitm.optimizer.deviation.classify_op`, or the
  predicted node goes permanently unmatched while the real kernel files as
  unmodeled. That is why three norm sites share one ``rms_norm`` op and why
  SwiGLU lives inside the GEMM that owns its needle. See
  ``docs/kernel_identity.md``.
