"""Predicted execution graph.

A flat list of predicted nodes per decode step. v0 is intentionally simple:
attention QKV projection, attention score (GQA-aware), attention output, MLP
gate+up, MLP down, vocab projection — one decode step worth.

v0 emits one decode step worth of nodes; multi-step and dependency-edge

    ``moe_layer`` selects the mixture arithmetic for *this* layer. MoE
    checkpoints are not uniformly sparse (see :meth:`ModelSpec.is_moe_layer`), so
    a dense block inside an MoE model is priced as a dense FFN.

    Dense (``num_experts == 0``) reproduces the original single-FFN arithmetic
    exactly. For MoE the two costs are driven by *different* counts, which is the
    whole point of the mixture:

    * **flops** scale with the experts each token activates — ``b * top_k``
      routed (plus every shared expert for every token), so compute grows
      linearly with batch;
    * **weight bytes** scale with the *distinct* experts the batch touches
      (:func:`distinct_experts`), because an expert's weights are read once per
      step however many tokens route to it — so traffic grows sublinearly and
      saturates at ``num_experts``.

    Weights use ``model.w_bytes`` and activations ``model.dtype_bytes``, so a
    quantized MoE checkpoint (fp8 weights, bf16 activations) is modeled with the
    right width on the term that dominates.

    The router GEMM (``[b, hidden] @ [hidden, num_experts]``) is folded into
    gate_up rather than given its own node: it is real but ~1% of expert-GEMM
    cost, and adding an op would change the canonical vocabulary that
    ``classify_op`` and ``library.yaml``'s ``applies_to_kernels`` key off.
