"""Roofline-based per-operation predictions.

For each op we compute:

    t_compute = flops / peak_flops_per_s
    t_memory  = bytes / peak_mem_bw
    t_pred    = max(t_compute, t_memory)

with a vendor-specific efficiency band ``(eff_lo, eff_hi)``: a kernel within
that band is "as expected". Residuals outside the band drive attribution.

The peak must match the op's dtype. A checkpoint that runs fp8 linears and
fp4 experts priced against a bf16 peak understates its own ceiling by 2-4x, and
an understated ceiling reads as recoverable headroom that isn't there — the one
error the headroom report exists to avoid making. ``roofline`` therefore resolves
a peak per dtype and records which peak it actually used, so a catalogue miss
surfaces as ``peak_is_fallback`` rather than as a confident wrong number.

    *union* of selected experts, which saturates:

        distinct(B) = E * (1 - (1 - k/E)^B)

    Under uniform routing, an expert is missed by one token with probability
    ``(1 - k/E)`` and by all ``B`` with that raised to ``B``. Two limits matter:

    * ``B * k << E`` -> ``distinct ~= B * k`` (linear; few collisions), and
    * ``B`` large    -> ``distinct -> E`` (every expert touched, so the step has
      fetched the *whole* model and MoE's bandwidth advantage over a dense model
      of the same total size is gone).

    The knee sits near ``B ~= E / k``. Because compute keeps growing linearly
    past it while bytes flatten, arithmetic intensity rises with batch — which is
    why MoE decode is memory-bandwidth-bound at low batch and only becomes
    compute-bound at large batch.

    Uniform routing is an assumption, not a measurement. Real routers are skewed,
    and skew makes tokens *collide* on hot experts, so the true distinct count is
    at or below this estimate — the prediction errs toward more traffic (slower),
    never toward an optimistic floor. Deviation detection only needs a stable,
    directionally-correct reference, and the expert-imbalance invariant is what
    measures the skew itself.

    Returns a float (an expectation, not a count). ``0.0`` when there is nothing
    to route.

    """Compute the roofline prediction for a single op.

    ``serial_launches`` adds a third bound for work whose cost is the number of
    *dependent* kernel launches rather than the arithmetic inside them. A
    roofline cannot see this: 20 Sinkhorn iterations over a 4x4 matrix move a few
    hundred bytes and do a few hundred FLOPs, so both classic terms round to
    zero, while the wall time is 20 launches deep and cannot be overlapped
    because each iteration consumes the previous one's output. Ignoring it does
    not make the prediction slightly optimistic — it makes it absent.
