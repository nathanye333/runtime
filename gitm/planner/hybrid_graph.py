    **The defaults below are a small reference shape, not any real checkpoint.**

    against; they are deliberately far too small for a deployment to be mistaken
    for one. Real checkpoints live in ``gitm/planner/models/*.yaml`` and load via
    :func:`gitm.planner.model_catalogue.load_spec`, or are read from a
    checkpoint's own ``config.json`` by :func:`spec_from_hf_config`.

    The separation is the point. When these defaults were one checkpoint's
    numbers, ``HybridMoEModelSpec()`` silently described that model, and every

    plausible while answering a question nobody asked. The comments below cite
