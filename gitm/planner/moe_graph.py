"""Predicted execution graph for a sparse-MoE decode step.

:func:`gitm.planner.graph.predict_graph` models a dense transformer, where three
things are true that make the roofline easy: every weight is read every step,
attention reads the whole KV cache, and one dtype prices the entire model. A
DeepSeek-V4-class checkpoint breaks all three, and each break is a term the dense
graph has no place to put:

**Expert weight traffic is a set-union problem, not a multiplication.** With
``num_experts_per_tok`` of ``n_routed_experts`` firing per token, FLOPs scale with
``positions x top_k`` — but HBM traffic scales with how many *distinct* experts the
batch collectively touched, which saturates at ``n_routed_experts`` and is the
dominant cost of a decode step. At batch 1 a step reads 6 of 256 experts; by batch
256 it reads essentially all of them for the same per-token FLOPs. The dense model
has no term that saturates, so it mispredicts the low-batch floor by ~40x and then
attributes the difference to a cause. The term itself is
:func:`gitm.planner.roofline.distinct_experts`, shared with the dense MoE roofline
rather than reimplemented here — it is the same union, and two copies of it would
drift.

**Attention is three mechanisms, not one.** Sliding-window layers read a fixed
recent window. CSA layers compress by ``m`` and then *select* ``index_topk``
entries with a lightning indexer, so their core read is bounded and flat in
context while their indexer scan grows. HCA layers compress by ``m' >> m`` and
attend *densely* with no indexer, so their read grows with context without bound
and they dominate the attention cost at long sequence lengths. Folding these into
one op — as a dense graph must — averages a 13x spread at 1M context and
attributes deviation to whichever layer happened to be modelled.

**Precision is per-tensor-class.** Experts run fp4, linears fp8, the KV cache fp8.
The load-bearing half of this is *bytes*, not FLOPs: pricing fp4 expert weights at
bf16 inflates the dominant term 3.3x. The peak-FLOPS half barely moves a decode
step — every node is memory-bound, so the compute ceiling never binds — but it
governs prefill, where it does.

Sharding is modelled per rank (:class:`ShardingConfig`): tensor parallelism splits
heads and dense linears, expert parallelism splits whole experts, and both emit the
collective they actually pay for. Two results fall out that the unsharded graph
could not express — TP does *not* divide KV traffic on a single-KV-head model, and
EP versus TP moves identical weight bytes per rank. Both are documented at the
nodes that produce them.

Known limits, stated rather than hidden:

* **Collectives are bandwidth-only.** No latency floor, so at decode message sizes
  the all-to-all and all-reduce nodes are optimistic; they carry ``estimated``. A
  SKU with no interconnect figure leaves them at zero, which
  :attr:`Graph.has_unpriced_collectives` surfaces rather than banking as free.
* **Uniform routing.** :func:`~gitm.planner.roofline.distinct_experts` assumes a
  balanced router.
  Real routing is skewed, which touches *fewer* distinct experts and so moves less
  weight traffic than predicted — the conservative direction, since it under-reports
  headroom rather than inventing it.
* **Nodes marked** ``estimated`` **are documented approximations** (grouped output
  projection, DSpark, every collective) and carry that flag into the report so an
  estimate is never read as a measurement.
* **Expert-parallel skew is calibrated, not predicted.**
  :attr:`ShardingConfig.ep_imbalance` defaults to perfect balance; the real figure
  comes from a trace. Inventing a routing distribution here would be a guess
  wearing a model's clothes.

    """KV positions the attention *core* reads for ``layer`` at ``kv_len`` context.

    Three layer kinds (paper §2.3), and conflating any two of them is the error
    this function exists to avoid:

    **swa — ratio 0.** Not compressed, but not global either: at most
    ``sliding_window`` recent tokens. Reading ``0`` as "uncompressed, therefore
    attends to everything" is wrong by ``kv_len / sliding_window`` — 512x at 64K.

    **csa — the smaller compression rate.** One entry per ``m`` tokens, then a
    lightning indexer scores those entries and keeps ``index_topk``. Bounded, so
    **flat in context** once selection saturates.

    **hca — the larger rate.** One entry per ``m' >> m`` tokens, attended
    **densely** — no indexer, no selection. So its read is ``kv_len / m'`` and
    **grows with context without bound**. HCA buys efficiency from the
    compression rate alone; CSA buys it from selection. That is the whole point
    of interleaving them, and it means the two cannot share a cost model.

    (Ratio 1 means genuinely uncompressed global attention. No layer of this
    checkpoint uses it; it is kept for other architectures.)

    The consequence worth internalising: **HCA is what makes long context
    expensive.** At 64K every layer reads 640 entries and the stack looks flat;
    by 1M the HCA layers read 8,320 each and account for the great majority of
    all attention traffic. A residual that scales with context therefore belongs
    to HCA or to the CSA indexer — never to a CSA core, which is genuinely
