"""Planner gate-context: the deployment facts levers are matched against.

The precondition gate (:mod:`gitm.optimizer.preconditions`) and the metrics
module (:mod:`gitm.optimizer.metrics`) both need ground truth about this box:
which SKU, what dtype, how big the KV cache, how many GPUs, NVLink or not, and
the hardware peak FLOP/bandwidth. This module assembles that once, from NVML and
the live engine, so downstream code never guesses.

Everything degrades cleanly: no NVML → read ``GITM_GPU_SKU``; unknown SKU →
``None`` peaks (HFU/MFU simply stay unreported rather than wrong). Engine
introspection is duck-typed so it survives vLLM version drift.
