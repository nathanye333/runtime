"""Autoresearch — propose non-catalog levers within the attributed bottleneck class.

The curated library (``library.yaml``) is finite. Autoresearch is the agentic
half of the README's "select from a library of known optimizations *and* run
agentic search for novel ones": it proposes real vLLM config knobs *outside*
that catalog, constrained to the bottleneck class the attribution layer
identified (idle / memory / compute).

Every proposal is then routed through the exact same path as a catalog lever:

1. the selection gate — :func:`gitm.agents.policy.select_interventions` — which
   pre-filters on the safety tier and qualification commit, then ranks the
   survivors by counterfactual replay (:func:`gitm.optimizer.replay.predict_delta`);
2. the rollback-gated live apply — :func:`gitm.optimizer.apply.apply_intervention` —
   which snapshots, applies, measures, and keeps only on a measured win.

A proposal the gate rejects is recorded and dropped; one that applies but does
not measurably help is rolled back. Autoresearch is a *candidate source*, not a
new trust path — nothing it proposes can bypass the gate or be kept without a
measured win.

The proposed knobs are real, current vLLM arguments (verified against
docs.vllm.ai); their expected deltas, however, are unproven estimates. The
``source`` field says so, and only the measured A/B keeps or discards them.

v0 classifies the bottleneck from trace telemetry (:func:`classify_bottleneck`,
weighted by the roofline model's per-op bound when residuals are available) and
repoints the search at the largest-residual op. Candidates come from one of
two sources behind the :class:`Proposer` seam: the static per-class table
(:func:`propose`) or :class:`GenerativeProposer`, which searches a workload's knob
surface (supplied by a :class:`KnobSource` — vLLM's ``EngineArgs`` by default) at
a small value grid per knob. The seam is workload-agnostic: a new workload plugs
in a KnobSource rather than a per-workload table. The loop runs the generative
proposer with the table as a fallback. Later versions learn an effect model from
realized deltas and sample the knob space stochastically.
