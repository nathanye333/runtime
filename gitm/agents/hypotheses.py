"""Registered hypotheses: interventions whose effect is derived before they run.

Autoresearch's other proposers search a knob surface and attach a flat, unproven
``expected_delta`` band to every candidate. A registered hypothesis differs in
one respect only: its expected effect, applicability and rejection condition are
*derived from the planner* for a named workload and written down (``docs/
hypotheses/``) before any measurement. It still enters through the same
:class:`~gitm.agents.autoresearch.Proposer` seam and the same selection gate,
rollback and measured-keep rule; nothing here is a new trust path.

Two conventions the gate imposes, stated because both are easy to get wrong:

* ``expected_delta_*`` on the emitted spec is the effect on the **covered ops**
  (``applies_to_kernels``), not on the step: ``replay.predict_delta`` multiplies
  it by the trace's coverage of those ops. The step-level figure a verdict is
  judged against lives in :class:`Prediction`.
* A hypothesis may target a knob the catalogue also carries. The catalogue entry
  is a hand-authored prior; this is a derivation for one workload, and the loop
  records which of the two produced a candidate by its name prefix.

Every uncertainty band here is the planner's own efficiency band
(``HardwareSpec.eff_lo``/``eff_hi``) applied to the nodes the intervention
changes. Where the intervention swaps the kernel, before and after may land
anywhere in the band independently; where the kernel is the same, both land at
the same efficiency. Times on the *measured basis* are floors divided by that
efficiency, so a total and its recoverable part are in the same units.
