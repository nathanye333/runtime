"""Which levers aim at the region that is actually losing time.

    table = from_trace("kimi.jsonl", graphs, steps=100)
    for t in targets(table, load_library(workload="vllm-decode")):
        print(t.row.region, t.row.recoverable_ms, [s.name for s in t.levers])

:mod:`gitm.optimizer.deviation_table` answers "where is time recoverable". The
intervention library answers "what can be changed". Nothing joined them: ranking
asked only how much of the trace a lever touches, so a lever with wide coverage
over a region already running at its predicted floor outranked one aimed at the
region that was actually over.

The join is by op, and the two vocabularies already agree — ``applies_to_kernels``
names the same canonical ops ``classify_op`` produces, which is what the library
header requires of every vLLM entry.

**A row with no op-scoped lever is a result, not an empty list to skip.** It
says nothing in the catalog is *aimed* at the place the time is going, which is
the most useful thing this module can report. It does not say nothing can affect
the region: whole-step levers apply to every row and are reported separately, so
an uncovered row still has those.

``moe_routed`` was the motivating case — half the predicted step on a sparse-MoE
checkpoint with no entry naming it. #124 scoped the MoE levers to it, so that
particular gap is closed; the query is what remains useful, and the test that
pinned the gap now pins its closure.

Deliberately not here: a score combining the two sides. ``recoverable_ms`` is a
duration and ``expected_delta_mean`` is a fraction of the whole step, so a product
of them is not a quantity anything measures. Picking the regions and listing what
aims at them is well defined on its own; how to order candidates *within* a region
is a separate decision with a separate answer.
