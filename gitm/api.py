    Either pass an ``engine`` (e.g. a running vLLM engine handle) for the
    embedded path, or pass ``workload`` (e.g. ``"vllm-decode"``) for the CLI
    path. ``budget`` and ``target`` follow the SKU contract: a verified floor
    of ``target`` fraction improvement within ``budget`` wall time, or a
    qualification-gate diagnostic explaining why the floor was not committed.

    ``use_history`` ranks candidates from what previous runs measured on this
    GPU rather than from the library's hand-authored estimates. It is never
    asked for here — this entry point does not touch stdin, so an embedded
    caller cannot be blocked by a prompt it did not expect. ``gitm run`` puts
    the question to the operator and passes the answer down.

    ``rerank`` decides what the run does with what it learns between one
    candidate and the next. ``"off"`` keeps the opening order to the end;
    ``"recapture"`` traces the workload again after each applied candidate and
    re-ranks what is left against it.

    ``skip_levers`` excludes levers from this run by name or knob, with shell
    globs, as a list or a comma-separated string. Merged with the
    ``GITM_SKIP_LEVERS`` environment variable. A lever can hang a model rather
    than merely regress it, and until now the only way past one was to edit the
    catalogue.

    ``workload_runner`` optionally supplies an explicit zero-arg callable that
    launches the workload's GPU work; it runs inside the capture window. When
    omitted, the loop resolves ``workload`` against the registry in
    :mod:`gitm.workloads`.
