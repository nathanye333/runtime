    tokens by elapsed seconds. Re-running the runner re-runs the decode under the
    engine's current config, so an in-place hot-swap is reflected in the measurement.

    Contract: this default probe re-runs the (potentially expensive) full workload
    and is bound to the *original* engine, so it is only valid for in-place
    hot-swap A/Bs. A deployment that supplies ``gitm_restart_fn`` (structural-knob
    restart-apply, which swaps in a *new* engine) MUST also supply an engine-aware
    ``gitm_throughput_fn`` — the default cannot measure the restarted engine.

    Both halves of that contract are now enforced rather than documented, and
    each refusal is a raise: :func:`apply_intervention` turns a failed measure
    into a restore with the error on the record, so the candidate is neither kept
    nor written to ``verification.json`` as a measured loss.

    * No runner: there is nothing to time. The old probe timed an empty call and
      divided 1 by ~1e-9 s, so keep-or-rollback followed timer noise.
    * A restarted engine: the runner drives the engine it was built with, so
      timing it after a restart measures the old engine and credits the new one.
    * No token count in the runner's output: the probe still works, as workload
      runs per second, and the unit is recorded so no report calls it tok/s.
    * The unit is fixed by an A/B's first call and held for that A/B. A speedup
      is a ratio of two probe calls, so a runner that reports ``generated_tokens``
      on one call and nothing (or ``decode_steps``) on the next would divide one
      unit by another; that call raises and the A/B ends as an error. The lock is
      keyed by :attr:`DegradationLog.current_scope`, so the next candidate starts
      fresh and a consistent A/B in another unit is still measured.
    * Any count other than ``generated_tokens`` is recorded as an

    """``(BatchConfig, source)`` carrying the *observed* decode batch, or ``(None, None)``.

    ``predict_graph``'s default is ``batch=1``. That is wrong for any real serving
    window and especially wrong for a mixture-of-experts model, where weight
    traffic scales with the distinct experts a batch activates: at top-8 of 256,
    a batch of 1 touches 8 experts but a batch of 16 touches ~100, so scoring a
    batch-16 step against the batch-1 ceiling understates expert traffic by more
    than 10x.

    Two sources, in order of directness:

    ``mean_running`` is vLLM's own count of concurrently running sequences, which
    *is* the decode batch. It is also the one most often missing: it comes off the
    scheduler, and for the offline ``LLM`` engine the scheduler lives in a separate
    process (``VLLM_ENABLE_V1_MULTIPROCESSING`` defaults on), so nothing in this
    process can reach it.

    ``mean_bounded_inflight`` comes from ``get_num_unfinished_requests()``, a
    method on the engine handle itself and therefore readable whatever the engine
    core does. It counts requests in flight rather than requests decoding, so
    each sample is an upper bound: anything the scheduler has admitted is
    decoding, anything it has not is queued. Bounding each sample by
    ``max_num_seqs`` — the most the engine will ever decode at once — turns that
    into the batch wherever the queue is what the surplus is, which is the shape
    of every workload gitm submits (all prompts at once, then drain). The
    bounding happens per sample in :func:`~gitm.tracer.vllm_stats.summarize`,
    which is not the same as bounding the average and is the reason this reads a
    separate field rather than clamping ``mean_unfinished`` here. Without a
    capacity to bound against it stays unused rather than becoming a guess.

    Returns ``(None, None)`` when neither is available — a CPU box, a dry run, or
    an engine that exposes no stats. Better a documented default than a fabricated
    batch, and the caller records which of the two it got.

    ``kv_cache_len`` is deliberately left at its default: nothing in the sampled
    stats gives a token count (``peak_gpu_cache_usage`` is a fraction of blocks,
    not a length), and inventing one would move the full-attention ceiling on a
    guess. Sourcing it is tracked separately.
