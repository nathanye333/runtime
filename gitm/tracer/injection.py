"""Cross-process trace collection via the CUDA driver's injection hook.
The in-process CUPTI shim can only see kernels launched by the interpreter that
imported it. vLLM's V1 engine runs the model in a separate ``EngineCore`` process,
so that shim captures nothing for a vLLM run — the trace comes back empty and the
pipeline reports "no-data". Disabling vLLM's multiprocessing would fix the symptom
and corrupt the measurement: ``EngineCore`` lives in its own process precisely to
keep the scheduler loop off the GIL that the frontend holds for detokenization, and
folding it back into the parent injects idle gaps that don't exist in production —
into exactly the stall/idle signal we are trying to measure.
So instead we let the CUDA driver load our collector into the child. Setting
``CUDA_INJECTION64_PATH`` makes the driver ``dlopen`` that library in every process
that initializes CUDA and call its ``InitializeInjection()`` before any kernel runs.
It is an ordinary environment variable, so it is inherited across fork/spawn. vLLM's
process model is untouched; it never knows we are there.
Each process writes ``$GITM_TRACE_OUT.<pid>`` (see ``cupti_inject.c``). This module
is the other half: it arms the window, merges the shards, and drops records outside
the window.
Both environment variables must be set **before the traced process starts CUDA**,
which for vLLM means before the engine is constructed — the driver reads
``CUDA_INJECTION64_PATH`` at CUDA init, long before ``capture()`` is entered. Export
them in the shell that launches the run; ``run_env()`` renders the exact pair.

    (roctx_shim.c), which interposes the legacy symbols in the emitting
