/*
 * cupti_inject — CUPTI collection for processes we don't control.
 *
 * Built as libgitm_inject.so: a plain shared library with NO libpython. Point the
 * CUDA driver at it with
 *
 *     export CUDA_INJECTION64_PATH=/abs/path/to/libgitm_inject.so
 *     export GITM_TRACE_OUT=/abs/path/to/trace.jsonl
 *
 * and the driver dlopens it inside every process that initializes CUDA — the
 * parent AND any child it forks or spawns — calling InitializeInjection() before
 * that process runs a single kernel. Because CUDA_INJECTION64_PATH is an ordinary
 * environment variable it is inherited across fork/spawn, which is the whole point:
 * vLLM's V1 engine runs the model in a separate EngineCore process, so a tracer
 * that only loads in the parent interpreter captures nothing. This is the same
 * mechanism nsys uses to follow children, and it needs no cooperation from vLLM —
 * its process model is untouched.
 *
 * Each process writes its own shard, $GITM_TRACE_OUT.<pid>, one JSON record per
 * line in exactly the dict shape gitm/tracer/_cupti_decode.py already consumes.
 * capture() merges the shards. Per-pid files because parent and child both load
 * this library and appending both to one file would interleave partial lines.
 *
 * Durability: records are written from the sink as CUPTI hands buffers back,
 * rather than accumulated and dumped at exit. A child that is SIGKILLed — or that
 * dies in its own shutdown path, which vLLM's EngineCore has been observed to do —
 * still leaves everything up to the last flush on disk. atexit() catches the tail
 * on a clean exit. We deliberately install NO signal handler: EngineCore installs
 * its own SIGTERM handler for orderly shutdown, and clobbering it from a library
 * the driver injected underneath the application would be a hostile thing to do.
 *
 * Arming: capture() creates $GITM_TRACE_OUT.arm on window open and removes it on
 * close, and this library only writes while it exists. Without that gate every
 * CUDA process on the box would stream records for its entire lifetime — for vLLM
 * that means ~80s of weight load, torch.compile and CUDA-graph capture before the
 * decode even starts, and an unbounded file on a 24h run. The check is one stat()
 * per completed buffer (8 MiB), not per kernel.
