/*
 * cupti_core — CUPTI Activity ingestion, with no opinion about where records go.
 *
 * Shared by the two build targets that need it:
 *
 *   cupti_shim.c    -> _cupti_shim<EXT>.so   CPython extension; sink appends to
 *                                            an in-memory list, marshalled on stop().
 *   cupti_inject.c  -> libgitm_inject.so     plain .so with no libpython, loaded
 *                                            into EVERY CUDA process by the driver
 *                                            via $CUDA_INJECTION64_PATH; sink writes
 *                                            JSONL straight to a per-pid file.
 *
 * The injection target is what lets us trace vLLM: its V1 engine runs the model in
 * a child process (EngineCore), so a tracer that only ever loads in the parent
 * interpreter sees zero kernels. The driver dlopens this library in the child at
 * CUDA init and calls InitializeInjection(), which is the only way in without
 * making vLLM disable its own process model.
 *
 * Everything unsafe lives here: buffer management, walking records with
 * cuptiActivityGetNextRecord, and reading fields off the real CUPTI structs whose
 * layout the compiler resolves against the installed cupti_activity.h. Callers only
 * ever see the normalized gitm_record below.
 *
 * Threading: CUPTI invokes buffer_completed on its own internal threads. The core
 * holds a mutex across a whole buffer and calls the sink under it, so sinks may be
 * written as if single-threaded — but they must not call back into Python without
 * taking the GIL, and they must not block.
