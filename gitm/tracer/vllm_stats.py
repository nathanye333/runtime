"""vLLM scheduler-stats adapter — engine-level telemetry alongside the CUPTI trace.

CUPTI tells us what the *GPU* did (per-kernel timings, streams). It cannot tell
us what the *engine scheduler* did: how deep the waiting queue got, how full each
decode batch was, whether sequences were preempted and recomputed. Those are the
signals that explain *why* the kernels look the way they do — a half-empty decode
batch is launch-bound for a scheduling reason, not a kernel reason — so this
series feeds causal attribution.

Usage mirrors :func:`gitm.tracer.capture.capture`: wrap the same window.

    from gitm.tracer.capture import capture
    from gitm.tracer.vllm_stats import sample_scheduler_stats

    with capture(trace_path) as trace, sample_scheduler_stats(engine) as stats:
        run_decode()
    stats.summary()  # peak queue depth, mean batch occupancy, preemptions, ...

Everything is **duck-typed and best-effort**: vLLM moves scheduler internals
between releases, so each field is probed across several known attribute paths
and silently left ``None`` when unavailable. A read never raises into the
workload, and on a box without vLLM the sampler degrades to an empty series — the
honest "no engine stats" outcome, never fabricated numbers.

    This only works in eager mode. Forward hooks are Python, and CUDA-graph
    replay executes no Python — so under vLLM's default

    learn which kernel names belong to which ops, then apply that mapping by
    name.

    Pops are registered with ``always_call`` where torch supports it. Without
