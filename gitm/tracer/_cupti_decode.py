"""Decode CUPTI activity records into GITM trace events.

The native shim (``gitm/tracer/_cupti/cupti_shim.c``) does the unsafe work —
buffer management, walking records with ``cuptiActivityGetNextRecord``, reading
fields off the real CUPTI structs (layout resolved by the compiler against the
installed ``cupti_activity.h``, never hand-guessed). It hands Python a flat list
of plain dicts. This module turns those dicts into validated
:class:`~gitm.tracer.schema.KernelEvent` / ``MemcpyEvent`` / ``SyncEvent``.

Keeping the boundary at dicts means all the interpretation logic — enum
mappings, field folding, schema validation — is pure Python and fully unit
tested without a GPU. The C side only copies primitives.

Dict contract (the shim emits exactly these shapes):

    kernel  {kind:"kernel", name, start_ns, end_ns, device_id, context_id,
             stream_id, correlation_id, grid:[x,y,z], block:[x,y,z],
             static_shared_mem, dynamic_shared_mem, registers_per_thread,
             graph_id, graph_node_id}

    graph_id/graph_node_id are 0 for a kernel launched outside a CUDA graph and
    are absent from captures taken before the collector emitted them; both
    decode to None.
    memcpy  {kind:"memcpy", copy_kind:int, bytes, start_ns, end_ns, device_id,
             context_id, stream_id, correlation_id}
    sync    {kind:"sync", sync_type:int, start_ns, end_ns, device_id,
             context_id, stream_id, correlation_id}
