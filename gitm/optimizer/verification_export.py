"""Customer-verification export — the A/B result as data, not prose.

The provenance report (:mod:`gitm.optimizer.report`) is written for a human: it
says a lever was kept and by how much. That is not enough for a customer who
wants to re-measure the claim on their own harness, because the report gives a
percentage and a sentence — not the configuration each number was measured
under, nor how much the measurement itself scattered.

This module writes the same A/B as structured data: both throughputs, the full
engine configuration on each side, the scatter and rep count behind them, and
the environment they were measured in. Nothing here measures anything new — the
numbers all come from :class:`~gitm.optimizer.apply.EngineABResult`, which the
loop already produces and currently reads two fields from.

Two things are deliberate:

* **``kept`` comes from the gate, not the measurement.** ``EngineABResult.kept``
  is a measure-time ``delta >= 0`` indicator; the authoritative keep/rollback
  decision is ``ApplyResult.rolled_back``, which applies the caller's
  ``min_keep_delta``. Exporting the indicator would occasionally claim a lever
  was kept that the gate actually rolled back.
* **An agreement band travels with every number.** At ``reps=1`` the measured
  scatter is exactly 0, so a customer re-measuring would "disagree" with us over
  ordinary run-to-run jitter. :data:`MIN_NOISE_BAND` floors the band so the
  export states the precision it actually has instead of implying certainty it
  doesn't.
