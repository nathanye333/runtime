"""Turn ranked candidates into the arms a harness can run.

    arms, unreachable = plan_arms(base_argv, ranked)
    write_experiments(path, baseline_argv=base_argv, arms=arms, ...)

The epic says the loop *"emits experiment specs for the runtime experiment
harness"*. Nothing wrote one: every manifest was hand-written, and the nine
intervention slots in ``scripts/kimi_loop/gen_pods.py`` are a person doing this
module's job from the ranked list by eye.

**The output shape is not invented.** An arm is what
:func:`gitm.optimizer.harness_results.read_capture` consumes on the way back —
a served model, a load shape, and a server argv — because the only emitted
format worth having is one whose results can be read back. So this module is
written as the inverse of :func:`~gitm.optimizer.harness_results.knob_difference`
and :func:`~gitm.optimizer.harness_results.resolve_lever`, and a test asserts
that over the whole catalogue: emit an arm for a lever, diff it against the
baseline, resolve it, and get the same lever. That is #125's claim — resolution
matches on knob *and* value, so a catalogue-generated manifest round-trips by
construction — turned into something that fails when it stops being true.

Being the exact inverse is what makes the three awkward cases visible rather
than silently broken:

* **A lever realised by removing a flag.** ``cuda_graphs_enable`` is
  ``enforce_eager: false``, which an arm realises by *not* passing
  ``--enforce-eager``. If the baseline does not pass it either, the arm is the
  baseline, and ``compare`` rightly refuses two arms that ran the same flags. So
  it is reachable only against a baseline that sets it, and that depends on the
  baseline rather than on the lever.
* **A lever the baseline already runs.** Emitting it produces an arm identical
  to the baseline, which measures nothing.
* **An environment-variable lever.** ``VLLM_ATTENTION_BACKEND`` is not a server
  flag, and ``knob_difference`` reads only ``serve_argv``, so nothing in the
  return path can see it. The arm is still worth running; its result cannot be
  attributed automatically, and saying so is better than emitting it as though
  it could.

None of those are refusals of the lever. They are reported alongside the arms,
because a sweep that quietly dropped three of its candidates looks like a sweep
of the ones that remained.
