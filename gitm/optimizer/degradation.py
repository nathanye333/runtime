"""Degradations — every place a run fell back instead of measuring, on the record.

The loop has many honest reasons to fall back: no engine attached, a config it
cannot read, a GPU it does not recognise, a runner that reports no token count,
vLLM absent so autoresearch searches a frozen catalog. Each fallback is fine *as
long as it is said*. What is not fine is the artifact that results: residuals
scored against Llama-2-7B, an A/B timed against a runner that does nothing, a
ranking built from a catalog the installed engine no longer has — written to disk
beside real measurements and indistinguishable from them.

One :class:`DegradationLog` is threaded through a run. Every fallback site records
what it used instead, why, and which artifacts rest on it. The log is then:

* written to ``degradations.json`` on **every** run, so a missing file never
  reads as "clean";
* carried on :class:`~gitm.optimizer.report.Provenance`, so it lands in the
  report and in ``verification.json``;
* summarised in the run summary (``degraded`` / ``degradations``), which
  ``gitm run`` echoes to stderr.

Severity is defined by what it *changes*, not as a label:

* ``unreliable`` — the affected numbers do not describe this run. An A/B
  measured under an unreliable entry is excluded from history
  (:func:`gitm.optimizer.history.load_history`), so a fabricated measurement
  cannot rank a lever on every run that follows.
* ``approximate`` — the numbers describe this run under a stated default (a
  batch of 1, A100 peaks, runs/s standing in for tokens/s). Reported, otherwise
  unchanged.

**Scope.** A degradation is either run-wide (``scope=None``: the runner failed,
the graph is a default) or belongs to the one candidate whose A/B it happened
during (``scope=<candidate name>``: the probe refused a restarted engine). The
loop and autoresearch open :meth:`DegradationLog.scope` around each apply, and
each verification record carries :meth:`DegradationLog.measured_under` for its
candidate. So one bad A/B late in a run costs that record, not the valid A/Bs
measured before it.
