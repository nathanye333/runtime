"""Deviation-only tracing — keep only the kernels that depart from prediction.

The behavioral compiler predicts a per-op execution graph; most kernels land
inside their roofline band and are *uninteresting* — they behaved exactly as
predicted, so storing them buys nothing. The optimization signal lives in the
*departures*: kernels slower (or heavier) than predicted, and kernels with no
predicted counterpart at all (unmodeled work). This module reduces a captured
trace to just those, so trace storage scales with deviation, not duration (the
monitor's design principle, applied to the trace itself).

    dev = deviating_kernel_indices(trace, graph)   # which observed kernels departed
    reduced = deviation_trace(trace, graph)         # a Trace of only those kernels

The band check mirrors :func:`gitm.optimizer.monitor.check_invariants` (same
``INVARIANTS`` band widths) but is applied per *observed kernel index* so each
departure maps back to its original event — the residual pass loses that link
because it keys by predicted op name (many kernels share one op).

    ``by_phase`` is ``{phase: {bucket: [count, ns]}}``. ``stats`` reports how the
    phase was decided, which is the part that governs how much to trust it.

    Only some kernels name their phase; MoE, the GEMMs, norms and elementwise
    work are byte-identical in both and are roughly three quarters of device
    time. With ``propagate`` those inherit the phase of the nearest kernel that
    *does* name one, on the reasoning that kernels adjacent in time belong to the
    same engine step.

    The assumption fails where a step genuinely mixes phases — chunked prefill
    schedules a prefill chunk alongside decode requests — so ``stats`` carries
    the median and worst distance to an anchor. A few microseconds means the
    neighbours are in the same step; milliseconds means the inference spans a
    step boundary and should not be believed.
