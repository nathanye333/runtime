    """Pair observed kernels to predicted nodes by op identity, not position.

    The old ordinal pairing matched a handful of early kernels against unrelated
    ops (orders of magnitude fewer predicted nodes than real kernels), producing
    runaway r_kt ratios. Each kernel is classified by its NVTX-range identity when
    the capture has one (``range_op``/``range_layer`` — see
    :mod:`gitm.distributed.correlate`), else by name
    (:func:`gitm.optimizer.deviation.classify_op`).

    **Pairing is per structural class, not one representative per op.** A dense
    transformer repeats one layer, so any node stands for all of them — that
    assumption is why this used to keep a single node per op. It does not survive
    a heterogeneous stack. On a DeepSeek-V4-class model, layers 0-1 are
    sliding-window (128 tokens, no indexer) while 2-42 are compressed (640
    tokens), and the compressed layers themselves split 32x apart at the indexer.
    Taking the first node per op made layer 0 the yardstick for all 43, which
    scores a perfectly healthy compressed layer at ``r_kt = +4.0`` against a
    ±0.4 band — and ``check_invariants`` treats a systematic offset as
    *confirmation*, so multi-basis filtering amplifies the artefact instead of
    rejecting it.

    Three cases, in order:

    * **Layer known** (NVTX capture): the exact ``(op, layer)`` node. Point
      residual, and ``layer`` is carried through.
    * **Layer unknown, op uniform**: the single class. Identical to the previous
      behaviour, which is every dense model and 8 of V4's 10 per-layer ops.
    * **Layer unknown, op heterogeneous**: an interval over the op's classes (see
      :func:`_interval_residual`), flagged by ``n_classes > 1``. Real deviations
      outside the whole span still surface; deviations *within* it are given up
      rather than guessed at, because guessing is what produced the artefact.

    The third case degrades to the first the moment NVTX ranges land, with no
    change here.

    gives the time it spent above its floor across the window directly. That
    matters: :mod:`gitm.optimizer.deviation_table` reaches the same quantity by

    can derive that count from a trace. Pairing per launch needs no step count
    at all, which is what makes this usable from inside the loop.

    ``None`` means *cannot be judged*, and is not the same as zero. An

    discard a lever aimed at a region that is genuinely over, so an op whose gap
    comes out at zero while it still has interval-based kernels is reported as

    either way — the interval kernels can only add to it — so it is reported as
    the number.

    An op with no kernels in the window simply does not appear. That is
