"""Apply an intervention spec to a live workload, behind a rollback gate.

    apply_intervention(spec, applicator) -> ApplyResult

Every live apply is wrapped in a snapshot → apply → measure → (keep | rollback)
cycle so a bad lever can never leave the workload worse than it started:

1. **snapshot** the pre-intervention state,
2. **apply** the spec's ``knob = value`` change (may raise on a bad value),
3. **measure** the resulting delta (a callback supplied by the caller),
4. **keep** it only if the measured delta clears ``min_keep_delta``; otherwise
   **restore** the snapshot.

Any exception in apply or measure also triggers a restore. The GPU-specific part
is isolated behind the :class:`Applicator` seam — :class:`ConfigFileApplicator`
edits a config file, :class:`DictApplicator` an in-memory dict (used in tests).
The live vLLM/engine applicator implements the same three methods (roadmap).

    * **scheduling** knobs are rare deployment-specific live controls. A joint
      candidate whose knobs are ALL scheduling is hot-swapped as one set.
      The curated vLLM EngineArg map intentionally treats scheduler-looking
      EngineArgs as structural because vLLM reads them at construction time.
    * **structural** knobs (parallelism, dtype, quantization, block size, …) can
      only take effect on a fresh engine, so they (or a joint set containing
      any structural knob) are routed through
      ``restart_fn(engine, {knob: value, ...}) -> new_engine``: the candidate
      engine replaces the live one for the A/B, and restore swaps the original
      back (shutting the candidate down best-effort). With no ``restart_fn`` a
      structural knob raises :class:`StructuralKnobRequiresRestart`, which
      ``apply_intervention`` turns into a clean rollback — never a silent no-op.

    The Applicator protocol's three phases map to a measured A/B: ``snapshot``
    benchmarks baseline decode throughput; ``apply`` hot-swaps or restarts;
    ``measure`` benchmarks the candidate and returns the signed speedup
    (``candidate/baseline - 1``), so a slowdown trips ``min_keep_delta`` and is
    rolled back via ``restore``.
