"""P1 separating experiment: is a config change multiplicative or additive on one op?

    python -m gitm.optimizer.separation inspect <trace.jsonl>
    python -m gitm.optimizer.separation analyze <run_dir> [--n-layers 61] [--concurrency 16]

The design is in ``docs/experiments/p1_fp8_kv_separation.md``; this module is its
decision rule, fixed before any hardware run. At one operating point a region
slowdown (``d → (1+α)·d``) and an in-kernel additive cost (``d → d + δ``) produce
the same trace (``docs/mechanism_model.md``, P1). Across operating points they do
not: regress the candidate's per-launch time on the baseline's,

    d_cand(x) = k · d_base(x) + m

and a pure slowdown has ``m = 0`` while a pure additive cost has ``k = 1``. Using
the baseline itself as the regressor, rather than the roofline ``t(x)``, means the
rule does not need the planner to be right about how the op scales (A4); it
needs only that the mechanism's parameters do not change with ``x`` (A5).

Everything here is pure Python, NumPy and SciPy. The tests run it on synthetic
traces from :mod:`gitm.optimizer.mechanism_fixtures` and on synthetic sweeps at
the hardware's scale.
