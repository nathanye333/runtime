"""Correlation of CUPTI activity records to NVTX ranges, scoped by process.

Correlation associates a device-side kernel record with the host-side launch
that issued it, and thence with the innermost enclosing NVTX range, yielding the
operation and layer identity that name-based classification cannot recover. See
``docs/kernel_identity.md``.

The chain spans three record kinds on two clock domains. A kernel's own
timestamps are device-clock and must never be compared against a range's
host-clock window, since asynchronous execution routinely places a kernel's
completion long after its enclosing range has been popped::

    kernel   (device clock)  correlation_id=X             [start_ns, end_ns]
        |  same correlation_id
    runtime  (host clock)    cudaLaunchKernel  id=X       [start_ns, end_ns], thread_id
        |  host-timestamp containment, same thread_id
    marker   (host clock)    NVTX range "L{layer}/{op}"   [start_ns, end_ns], thread_id

Record contract, as emitted by the collector::

    kernel   {kind:"kernel",  correlation_id:int, start_ns:int, end_ns:int, ...}
    runtime  {kind:"runtime", correlation_id:int, start_ns:int, end_ns:int,
              thread_id:int}
    marker   {kind:"marker",  name:str, start_ns:int, end_ns:int, thread_id:int}

A ``marker`` record is one fully-resolved push/pop range, with start and end
already paired.

CUDA graphs
-----------
The chain above names the op only for an eagerly launched kernel. A graph
replay is one ``cudaGraphLaunch``, and every kernel it runs carries that one
launch's ``correlation_id``, so the range enclosing the launch is whatever
encloses the replay: a step, a layer group, or nothing. Taking it as the op
would hand every kernel in the replay the same, wrong identity. A kernel with a
nonzero ``graph_id`` therefore gets that range only as ``launch_range`` (a
time-series label), and ``range_op``/``range_layer`` come from the graph node
instead::

    kernel      graph_node_id=N
        |  same graph_node_id (following cloned_from to the captured node)
    graph_node  {kind:"graph_node", graph_node_id:int, name:str,
                 cloned_from:int | None}

A ``graph_node`` record names the innermost NVTX range open on the capturing
thread when the node was created, which is how Nsight Systems projects ranges
onto replayed kernels. The collector does not emit these yet (it needs CUPTI's
graph-node resource callbacks), so today a graph kernel's op is ``None`` and
falls back to name classification, rather than silently taking the step's.

Process scoping
---------------
``correlation_id`` is assigned by CUPTI per process, numbered from a low origin
in each. Under tensor or expert parallelism the identifier is therefore not
unique across a capture: ranks executing equivalent work issue equivalent launch
sequences and allocate overlapping identifier ranges. Correlating a merged
record sequence resolves each identifier to whichever record was indexed last,
so range attribution is drawn from an arbitrary rank. ``thread_id``, applied as
a secondary constraint, is likewise process-scoped and provides no cross-process
discrimination.

The resulting error is silent: every kernel receives a syntactically valid
``range_op`` and ``range_layer``, wrong only in which rank supplied it.
:func:`correlate_by_rank` removes it by partitioning records by originating
process before correlation and merging only afterwards, confining identifier
resolution to the scope in which identifiers are unique.

    contains that runtime record. Input order is preserved. Runtime, marker and
    graph_node records are consumed to build the correlation index and are not
    returned.

    A kernel with a nonzero ``graph_id`` also carries ``launch_range``, the raw

    ``range_layer`` from its graph node only (module docstring, "CUDA graphs").

    Replaces a nested scan of every marker per kernel. That scan is O(k·m), and
    the shapes are not small: a 4,096-step capture instrumented at
    ``L{layer}/{op}`` granularity emits on the order of 800k markers against 9.5M
    kernels, which is 7.8e12 comparisons — about a day of CPU. This is
    O((n+m) log(n+m)), ~2.4e8 operations on the same input.

    The algorithm is a per-thread sweep. NVTX ranges on a single thread are
    pushed and popped as a stack, so at any instant the open ranges *are* a
    stack, ordered outermost to innermost. Walking events in time order and
    maintaining that stack means the innermost range containing a launch is at
    or near its top.

    "Near", not "at": containment requires the marker to cover the launch's
    ``end`` as well as its ``start``, and an asynchronous launch can outlive the
    range that issued it. So the stack is walked down from the top until a range
    covers the whole window. Nesting depth is a handful, so this is effectively
    constant per query rather than a second linear scan.

    Threads are handled separately throughout. A launch on one thread must never
    be attributed to a range pushed on another; grouping first also keeps each
    stack a genuine stack, which interleaved threads would not be.
