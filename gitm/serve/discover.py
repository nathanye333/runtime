"""Find the vLLM server to attach to, and decide whether it can be traced at all.

Everything here is ``/proc`` and the current user: no root, no ptrace, no phone-home,
matching the fail-open contract in :mod:`gitm.deploy.attach`. Resolution is local by
construction — a PID, a port, or a scan of this box's process table.

The constraint this module exists to state plainly: **the CUDA driver reads
``CUDA_INJECTION64_PATH`` exactly once, at CUDA init, and never looks again.** A vLLM
server that started without it cannot be made traceable while it runs — not by us,
not by nsys, not by anything short of restarting the process. So "attach" here means
*adopting* a server that was already launched under the injection library; what gitm
adds is finding it, proving it is ours, and bounding a window inside its lifetime.

That is worth saying up front rather than discovering it as an empty trace an hour
later, so :func:`classify` reports untraceable targets with the exact environment to
restart under, and the attach path refuses to arm a window it knows will be empty.

The one piece of good news: because the arm marker is a file the injected collector
stats on every buffer flush, the process that opens the window does not have to be
the process that launched the server. A long-lived server can be captured many times
by many short-lived gitm invocations.
