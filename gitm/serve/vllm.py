"""Traced ``vllm serve`` run — launch the OpenAI server, drive load, keep the CUPTI trace.

This is the launch half of vLLM kernel capture; :mod:`gitm.serve.attach` is the
half that adopts a server someone else already started. Both end in the same
artifacts, because the only difference between them is who owns the process.

The in-process vLLM path (``gitm run --workload vllm-decode``) builds an ``LLM``
and calls ``generate``. An OpenAI server is a different shape: it is a long-lived
process that must be up, warm, and past CUDA-graph capture before any measurement is
meaningful, and the load has to arrive over HTTP. This module is that shape, reusing
the tracer unchanged:

  1. preflight — GPU count vs TP, NVLink topology, driver/vLLM CUDA majors, the
     injection library, the CUPTI clock, and the serve flags themselves (parsed by
     the installed vLLM's own parser, so a bad flag costs a second instead of the
     ~90s+ it takes to die after the weight load).
  2. launch ``vllm serve`` with ``CUDA_INJECTION64_PATH`` exported. The driver
     dlopens our collector into EngineCore and every TP worker; the in-process shim
     cannot see any of them. See gitm/tracer/injection.py.
  3. wait for ``/health``, then warm up — both OUTSIDE the capture window. Weight
     load, torch.compile and CUDA-graph capture are ~80s of kernels that would
     otherwise dominate the trace and make kernel-time coverage meaningless.
  4. arm the window (``capture()``), drive closed-loop streaming load, disarm.
  5. write the merged trace + a client-side serving summary + /metrics snapshots.

    gitm capture serve                       # the pinned experiment below
    gitm capture serve --dry-run             # preflight only, no GPU needed
    gitm capture serve -- vllm serve OTHER/MODEL --tensor-parallel-size 2

``--keep-server`` leaves the process up afterwards, which is the intended handoff
into ``gitm capture attach``: one launch, many capture windows.

Exit codes: 0 = trace captured, 1 = failed, 2 = skipped (preflight says this box
cannot run it).
